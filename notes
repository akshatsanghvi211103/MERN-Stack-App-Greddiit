Maybe if u **hover on a user** u can get his fname and lname

Make a game page for when the user goes into the wrong URL...maybe with the anime.js background thing...put the hacker effect also

Make sure that if a page is empty, it shows a message of nothing present

Be careful while reading input values, they cud clash with the other page's input values

I have added conditions in the "func" function, just check them once if u face a problem

The reports should only be seen by the admin, and the admin should be able to delete the post

Dont forget to show the success messages, after some event occurs

The banned words should be capital insensitive, also alert in the post is nessecary

The checkauth should check if the token is correspoding to the same user or not : YATHARTH

Im counting the visits in a subGreddiit by counting the number of getPosts calls, be careful to not call it somewhere else

Banned user even in saved posts

The search is recursive, it acts on the current subGs persent on the page
